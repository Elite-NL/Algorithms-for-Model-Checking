% this mu-formula checks whether player 2 can always force a win, regardless of player 1's strategy to prevent it

% X is the set of states such that player 2 can always force a win
% <won>true is the state that represents (N,N), so player 2 wins in this state
% <choose1>X is the set of states where player 1 can choose to move to X
% [choose1]X is the set of states where all moves by player 1 will move to X
% (<choose1>X && [choose1]X) is the set of states where player 1 can make at least 1 move and all such moves go to X
% <choose2>X is the set of states where player 2 can choose to move to X

mu X.(<won>true || ((<choose1>X && [choose1]X) || <choose2>X))

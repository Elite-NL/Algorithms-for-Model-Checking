% this mu-formula checks whether player 2 can always force a win, regardless of player 1's strategy to prevent it

% X represents the set of states such that player 2 can always force a win
% <won>true is the state that represents (N,N), so player 2 wins in this state
% we add to this the set of states where player 2 can choose to move to X: <choose2>X
% we add to this the set of states where player 1 can move to X AND has no choice but to move to X: (<choose1>X && [choose1]X)

mu X.(<won>true || ((<choose1>X && [choose1]X) || <choose2>X))

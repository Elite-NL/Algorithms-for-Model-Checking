% note that this mu-formula doesn't imply that player 2 can always force a win (regardless of player 1's strategy to prevent it)
% this formula only says that there exists some play such that player 2 wins.

% X represents the set of states such that player 2 has the possibility to win
% <won>true is the state that represents (N,N), so player 2 wins in this state
% we add to this the set of states where player 2 can choose to move to X: <choose2>X
% we add to this the set of states where player 1 can choose to move to X: <choose1>X

mu X.(<won>true || (<choose1>X || <choose2>X))

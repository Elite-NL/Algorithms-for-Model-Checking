% note that this mu-formula doesn't imply that player 2 can always force a win (regardless of player 1's strategy to prevent it)
% this formula only says that there exists some play such that player 2 wins.

% X represents the set of states at the start of a round such that player 2 has the possibility to win
% <won>true is the state that represents (N,N), so player 2 wins in this state
% <choose2>X is the set of states where player 2 can choose to move to X
% <choose1><choose2>X is the set of states where player 1 can move to <choose2>X

mu X.(<won>true || <choose1><choose2>X)

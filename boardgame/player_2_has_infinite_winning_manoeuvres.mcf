% player II wins a play iff she infinitely often manoeuvres the token to position (N, N)
% and she can always force a win, regardless of player I's strategy to prevent it

% X represents the set of states such that player II can always force a win
% Y represents the previous approximation of states that have a winning strategy (starting with all states)
% to get infinite wins, player II must be able to reach the state (N, N) infinitely often
% so we intersect with states that can reach the previous approximation of states that have a winning strategy
% this way we cannot stop after reaching the state (N, N) once
